## Context Manifest

### How The App Codebase Currently Works: Document Generation Framework

The app directory contains a sophisticated document generation framework built on a plugin-based architecture with multi-agent orchestration, Azure OpenAI integration, and Jinja2 templating. The system transforms regulatory documents (like informed consent forms) into structured summaries using advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques.

**Core Architecture Flow:**
When a user uploads a PDF document through the FastAPI endpoints (`/uploadfile/` or `/generate/`), the request first hits `app/main.py` which serves as the entry point. The main application creates a `DocumentGenerationFramework` instance that orchestrates the entire processing pipeline. The PDF is first processed by `app/pdf.py` using PyPDF to extract text and page labels into a `PDFPages` dataclass. This raw text is then converted into a LlamaIndex `Document` object with metadata preservation.

The framework then selects an appropriate plugin from `app/plugins/` directory using the `PluginManager` in `app/core/plugin_manager.py`. The plugin manager dynamically discovers and loads document plugins at runtime by scanning Python files that extend the `DocumentPlugin` abstract base class. Each plugin defines specialized extraction logic, validation rules, and template catalogs for specific document types.

**Multi-Agent Processing Pipeline:**
Once a plugin is selected, the framework initializes a `MultiAgentPool` from `app/core/multi_agent_system.py` with various specialized agents:
- **ExtractionAgent**: Uses regex patterns and Azure OpenAI to extract key information from documents
- **GenerationAgent**: Leverages LLM integration to generate natural language content for template slots
- **ValidationAgent**: Ensures extracted values meet validation rules and preserve intent
- **SpecialistAgent**: Handles domain-specific processing like template selection and sub-template routing

The agents operate in a coordinated pipeline, sharing context through an `AgentContext` object that accumulates extracted values, generated content, and validation results. Messages are passed between agents for coordination and error handling.

**Template Processing and Rendering:**
The extracted and generated content is then passed to the `Jinja2Engine` in `app/core/template_engine.py`. This engine supports template inheritance, custom filters, and dynamic template resolution. Templates are organized hierarchically under `app/templates/` with a base master template and document-type-specific templates. For informed consent documents, the system uses a 9-section Key Information Summary template structure where each section can contain conditional logic based on extracted values (e.g., pediatric vs. adult language, randomization notices).

The template engine merges extracted values, generated content, and global parameters into a unified context. Custom filters handle text processing like capitalization, word limiting, and duplicate removal. Template slots support different types (static, extracted, generated, conditional, propagated) with cross-reference capabilities for value consistency.

**Enhanced Validation and Consistency:**
After template rendering, the `EnhancedValidationOrchestrator` in `app/core/document_framework.py` performs comprehensive validation including:
- Required field validation against plugin-defined rules
- Length constraints and allowed value checking
- Critical value preservation to ensure important information isn't lost during generation
- Consistency metrics calculation including coefficient of variation tracking (target < 15%)
- Prohibited phrase detection to catch AI-generated artifacts
- Structural consistency checking for proper section formatting

**Azure OpenAI Integration:**
The system integrates with Azure OpenAI through `app/core/llm_integration.py` using LlamaIndex's Azure OpenAI wrapper. The `GenericLLMExtractor` class provides structured extraction capabilities using Pydantic models defined in `app/core/extraction_models.py`. This enables type-safe extraction with automatic schema validation. The integration supports various extraction types (boolean, enum, text, numeric) with configurable parameters like temperature (set to 0 for consistency) and top_p values.

**RAG Pipeline with SPLICE Chunking:**
For document processing, the system implements a sophisticated RAG pipeline in `app/core/rag_pipeline.py` using the SPLICE (Semantic Preservation with Length-Informed Chunking Enhancement) method. This chunker intelligently splits documents while preserving semantic boundaries and maintaining context through hierarchical metadata. The pipeline builds vector indices using LlamaIndex and supports streaming query capabilities for real-time updates.

**Configuration and State Management:**
All application settings are centralized in `app/config.py` which replaces hardcoded values throughout the codebase. This includes memory configuration, text processing limits, Azure OpenAI settings, CORS security policies, and logging configuration. The logger system in `app/logger.py` provides consistent logging across all modules with rotating file handlers and configurable levels.

**Plugin System Architecture:**
The two main plugins demonstrate the framework's flexibility:
- **InformedConsentPlugin** (`app/plugins/informed_consent_plugin.py`): Handles IRB Key Information Summary generation with 9-section structured output, pediatric language adaptation, and specialized extraction patterns
- **ClinicalProtocolPlugin** (`app/plugins/clinical_protocol_plugin.py`): Implements a 7-step workflow for clinical protocol generation including template selection, value propagation, sub-template selection, and intent validation

### Current Code Quality Issues Identified

**Type Annotations and Documentation:**
Many functions lack comprehensive type hints, particularly in the core framework classes. For example, `app/core/multi_agent_system.py` has several methods returning `Dict[str, Any]` instead of more specific types. Complex data structures like `AgentContext` and `ChunkMetadata` could benefit from more detailed type annotations. Docstrings are inconsistent across modules, with some functions having detailed documentation while others have minimal or missing descriptions.

**Error Handling Inconsistencies:**
Error handling patterns vary throughout the codebase. Some modules use try-catch blocks with generic `Exception` handling (like in `app/core/llm_integration.py` lines 91-94), while others have more specific error types. The framework lacks a unified error handling strategy with proper error propagation and user-friendly error messages. Many functions silently return default values on errors rather than properly logging or bubbling up exceptions.

**Code Duplication and Repetition:**
Several areas show code duplication:
- Template path resolution logic appears in multiple plugins with slight variations
- Validation logic is repeated across different validation methods in `EnhancedValidationOrchestrator`
- Agent creation patterns are duplicated in both plugin classes
- File path handling and document conversion logic appears in multiple locations (`main.py`, `summary.py`, test files)

**Complex Functions Needing Refactoring:**
The `EnhancedValidationOrchestrator.validate()` method in `app/core/document_framework.py` (lines 88-131) is overly complex with multiple responsibilities. It should be broken down into smaller, focused methods. Similarly, the `DocumentGenerationFramework.generate()` method (lines 420-483) handles too many concerns in a single function. The `InformedConsentPlugin.process()` method in the KIExtractionAgent contains extensive conditional logic that could be simplified.

**Inconsistent Naming Conventions:**
Variable naming is inconsistent across modules. Some use snake_case consistently while others mix camelCase. Class names generally follow PascalCase but some attributes use inconsistent patterns. Magic strings and numbers appear throughout the code without being defined as constants.

**Missing Abstractions and Interfaces:**
While the plugin system uses abstract base classes, some areas lack proper abstractions. The agent system could benefit from more specific interfaces for different agent types. Template handling lacks consistent interfaces between different template types. The validation system mixes different validation types without clear separation of concerns.

### Areas Requiring Refactoring Priority

**High Priority - Core Framework Stability:**
1. **Agent System Redesign**: The multi-agent system needs cleaner interfaces and better separation of concerns between different agent roles
2. **Error Handling Standardization**: Implement consistent error handling with proper exception types and error propagation
3. **Validation Framework**: Break down the monolithic validation orchestrator into focused, testable components
4. **Type Safety**: Add comprehensive type hints throughout the core framework modules

**Medium Priority - Code Organization:**
1. **Plugin Interface Standardization**: Ensure all plugins follow consistent patterns for template resolution, validation rules, and agent management
2. **Template System Refactoring**: Simplify template path resolution and improve template context management
3. **Configuration Management**: Consolidate remaining hardcoded values and improve configuration validation
4. **Logging Standardization**: Ensure consistent logging patterns across all modules

**Lower Priority - Code Quality:**
1. **Function Decomposition**: Break down overly complex functions into smaller, testable units
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Add comprehensive docstrings and type documentation
3. **Code Deduplication**: Eliminate repeated code patterns and create reusable utilities
4. **Naming Convention Cleanup**: Standardize variable and method naming throughout the codebase
