# Address Technical Debt

## Problem/Goal

A comprehensive technical debt analysis identified 37 issues across the codebase with an overall health score of 6.2/10. This task addresses the critical and high-priority issues that impact system reliability, maintainability, and deployment stability.

Key findings:
- 2 CRITICAL issues (bare except clauses, silent failures)
- 8 HIGH issues (debug prints, sys.path manipulation, tight coupling)
- 16 MEDIUM issues (test coverage, type hints, documentation)
- 11 LOW issues (performance, logging, modularity)

Total estimated effort: 25-30 hours across multiple phases.

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (2.5 hours)
- [ ] Replace all `print()` statements with proper `logger` calls
- [ ] Fix all bare `except:` clauses (8 instances)
- [ ] Remove unused RAG references from codebase
- [ ] Fix hardcoded CORS configuration in main.py

### Phase 2: Critical Issues (4.5 hours total)
- [ ] Fix silent error handling in document_processor.py
- [ ] Fix silent error handling in unified_extractor.py
- [ ] Add proper error propagation for empty data cases
- [ ] Add validation for critical extraction failures

### Phase 3: High-Priority Issues (6.5 hours total)
- [ ] Eliminate sys.path manipulation in document_framework.py
- [ ] Fix sys.path usage in plugin files (2 instances)
- [ ] Implement proper package structure for imports
- [ ] Standardize configuration management across api.py and main.py
- [ ] Remove debug/temporary code from production files

### Phase 4: Medium-Priority Issues (12+ hours)
- [ ] Add comprehensive type hints to core modules
- [ ] Improve test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] Update documentation for refactored modules
- [ ] Address code duplication patterns
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback

### Phase 5: Long-Term Improvements (8+ hours)
- [ ] Performance optimization (LLM caching, batch processing)
- [ ] Enhanced logging and monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Modular service boundaries and dependency injection
- [ ] Comprehensive integration test suite

## Subtasks

This task is broken into phases for incremental progress:

1. **01-quick-wins.md** - Immediate fixes (2.5 hours)
2. **02-critical-issues.md** - Critical error handling (4.5 hours)
3. **03-high-priority.md** - Architecture improvements (6.5 hours)
4. **04-medium-priority.md** - Code quality enhancements (12+ hours)
5. **05-long-term.md** - Performance and infrastructure (8+ hours)

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach
- Start with quick wins for immediate value
- Address critical issues before they cause production problems
- Tackle high-priority items that improve developer experience
- Schedule medium and long-term improvements incrementally

### Testing Strategy
- Add tests before refactoring critical paths
- Verify no regression after each phase
- Use consistency report to validate document generation stability
- Run existing test suite after each change

### Risk Mitigation
- Create feature branch for all changes
- Make atomic commits per issue
- Test thoroughly before merging
- Keep PRs focused and reviewable

## Context Files

### Core Modules
- @app/core/document_framework.py - sys.path manipulation, debug prints
- @app/core/plugin_manager.py - debug prints, error handling
- @app/core/document_processor.py - silent error handling
- @app/plugins/informed_consent/unified_extractor.py - silent failures
- @app/main.py - hardcoded CORS configuration
- @app/api.py - configuration inconsistencies

### Hook Files (Bare Except Clauses)
- @.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.py
- @.claude/hooks/post-tool-use.py
- @.claude/hooks/session-start.py
- @.claude/hooks/memory-capture.py
- @.claude/hooks/shared_state.py
- @.claude/hooks/update_memory.py
- @.claude/hooks/knowledge_graph.py

### Test Files
- @tests/test_ki_summary.py
- @tests/test_consistency.py
- @tests/fixtures.py

## User Notes

### Priority Rationale
This is high priority because:
1. Critical issues (bare except, silent failures) can hide production bugs
2. sys.path manipulation causes deployment fragility
3. Debug prints pollute production logs
4. Quick wins provide immediate ROI (2.5 hours = significant value)

### Phased Approach Benefits
- Incremental progress allows for testing between phases
- Can pause/resume between phases based on priorities
- Early phases unblock later phases
- Allows parallel work on independent issues

### Dependencies
- No external dependencies for Phase 1-3
- Phase 4-5 may require coordination with other work
- All phases should maintain backward compatibility
