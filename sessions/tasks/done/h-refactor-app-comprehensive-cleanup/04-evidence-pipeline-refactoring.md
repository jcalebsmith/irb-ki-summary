# Evidence Pipeline Refactoring

## Objective
Remove complexity from evidence extraction pipeline and ensure robust, simple implementation.

## Scope
- app/core/evidence_extraction_agent.py
- app/core/evidence_models.py
- app/core/evidence_pipeline.py
- app/core/extraction_models.py
- app/core/simple_extraction.py

## Current Issues to Address
- [ ] Complex nested data structures
- [ ] Redundant extraction logic
- [ ] Unclear separation of concerns
- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] Placeholder implementations

## Simplification Goals
- [ ] Merge redundant extraction modules
- [ ] Create single, clear extraction pipeline
- [ ] Use dataclasses/Pydantic consistently
- [ ] Implement proper validation at each stage
- [ ] Remove unnecessary abstraction layers

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Consolidate extraction logic into single module
- [ ] Implement clear data flow pipeline
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create extraction result validation
- [ ] Remove all TODO placeholders
- [ ] Add detailed logging at each stage

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test with real PDF documents
- [ ] Validate extraction accuracy
- [ ] Test error scenarios with malformed data
- [ ] Performance testing with large documents
- [ ] Integration tests with full pipeline

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Single, clear extraction pipeline
- [ ] All placeholders replaced with working code
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Real document tests passing
- [ ] Performance metrics documented
- [ ] Code reduction of at least 40%
