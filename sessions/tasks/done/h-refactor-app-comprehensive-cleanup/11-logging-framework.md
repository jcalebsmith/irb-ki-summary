# Logging Framework

## Objective
Verify and enforce consistent logging patterns throughout the application.

## Scope
- app/logger.py
- All modules using logging
- Log output formats
- Log rotation and management

## Current Issues
- [ ] Inconsistent logging levels
- [ ] Missing correlation IDs
- [ ] Poor error context in logs
- [ ] Missing performance metrics
- [ ] Unclear log formatting

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Audit all logging statements
- [ ] Standardize log levels usage
- [ ] Add correlation ID tracking
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Add performance logging
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Implement log rotation

## Logging Categories
- [ ] Request/response logging
- [ ] Error and exception logging
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Business events
- [ ] Security events
- [ ] Debug information

## Best Practices to Implement
- [ ] Use structured logging (JSON)
- [ ] Add request correlation IDs
- [ ] Include context in error logs
- [ ] Implement log sampling
- [ ] Add metric collection
- [ ] Configure appropriate log levels

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test log output formats
- [ ] Test log rotation
- [ ] Test performance impact
- [ ] Test log correlation
- [ ] Test error logging

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Consistent logging throughout
- [ ] Structured logs implemented
- [ ] Correlation IDs working
- [ ] Performance metrics captured
- [ ] Log rotation configured
- [ ] Logs easily searchable
