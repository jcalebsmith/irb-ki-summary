## Problem/Goal
The codebase contains significant technical debt that impacts maintainability, security, and development velocity. A comprehensive code review identified ~2,000+ lines of duplicated code, security vulnerabilities, hardcoded values, deprecated code in production, and architectural anti-patterns. This task addresses the critical and high-priority issues systematically.

## Success Criteria
### Critical (Week 1)
- [x] Fix CORS security configuration - replace `["*"]` with proper origin list
- [x] Replace 4 bare exception handlers with specific exception types
- [x] Remove or properly archive the `archived_version` directory (~1,400 lines of duplication)

### High Priority (Month 1)
- [x] Extract hardcoded values to configuration files
  - [x] Memory limits (max_entities: 5000, max_episodes: 1000, etc.)
  - [x] Token limits (MAX_TOKENS_PER_BATCH: 18000)
  - [x] Truncation limits (200, 150, 8000, 4000 characters)
  - [x] Test data paths (test_data/HUM00173014.pdf)
- [x] Replace 315+ print statements with proper logging framework
- [x] Consolidate duplicated test utilities and Azure OpenAI configuration blocks
- [x] Remove deprecated API endpoints (app/main.py:281-303)

### Medium Priority (Quarter 1)
- [x] Complete placeholder implementations in multi_agent_system.py
- [x] Implement proper test fixtures to replace hardcoded test data

### How the Current System Works: IRB KI Summary Document Generation Platform

**Overview of the Architecture:**
The IRB KI Summary system is a sophisticated document generation platform built on FastAPI with a plugin-based architecture that transforms regulatory documents into structured summaries. The system implements multiple layers of abstraction to handle different document types (informed consent, clinical protocols) through specialized plugins, templates, and validation systems.

**Core Application Flow (app/main.py):**
When a user uploads a document to the `/uploadfile/` endpoint, the request first passes through the CORS middleware configured at line 28. This middleware is currently configured with `allow_origins=["*"]` which presents a significant security vulnerability as it permits requests from any origin. The application then instantiates a `DocumentGenerationFramework` object which serves as the main orchestrator for the entire document processing pipeline.

The PDF processing begins with the `read_pdf()` function that extracts text from uploaded files, converting them into `Document` objects from the llama_index library. This document is then passed to the framework's `generate()` method along with parameters specifying the document type ("informed-consent-ki" for the legacy endpoint). The framework coordinates plugin selection, template rendering, LLM processing, and validation through its orchestration engine.

**Plugin Architecture (app/plugins/):**
The system uses a runtime plugin discovery mechanism managed by the `PluginManager` class. Each document type (informed consent, clinical protocol) is implemented as a separate plugin extending the `DocumentPlugin` abstract base class. The `InformedConsentPlugin` handles KI summary generation with 9 structured sections, while the `ClinicalProtocolPlugin` (571 lines - a "god object" requiring refactoring) manages complex clinical research protocol workflows with regulatory-specific sub-templates.

The plugin system implements template slot types (STATIC, EXTRACTED, GENERATED, CONDITIONAL, PROPAGATED) that determine how content is processed. Critical values like study names, endpoint definitions, and safety criteria are marked with `intent_preservation=True` to ensure they survive LLM processing without modification.

**Template System and Content Processing:**
Templates are built using Jinja2 and organized hierarchically in `app/templates/`. The system supports template inheritance where base templates provide common structure and document-specific templates add specialized sections. Template slots are populated through a multi-step process: extraction from source documents, LLM-based content generation, and validation against predefined rules.

The `StreamingRAGPipeline` implements SPLICE chunking for optimal document processing, breaking large documents into semantically meaningful chunks that maintain context across boundaries. This is crucial for regulatory documents that often exceed token limits but require coherent processing.

**Multi-Agent Orchestration (app/core/multi_agent_system.py):**
The framework implements a multi-agent system with specialized roles: `ExtractionAgent` pulls information from documents, `GenerationAgent` creates new content, `ValidationAgent` ensures compliance, and `SpecialistAgent` handles domain-specific processing. However, this system has placeholder implementations at line 128 and beyond - a critical gap that needs completion.

Agents communicate through `AgentMessage` objects and share context through `AgentContext` dataclass. The orchestration ensures that extracted values are propagated consistently across document sections, maintaining regulatory compliance throughout the generation process.

**Validation and Consistency System:**
The `EnhancedValidationOrchestrator` implements strict consistency checking using multiple metrics. The `ConsistencyMetrics` class tracks coefficient of variation (CV) across multiple document generations, with a target of CV < 15% for good consistency. Content hashes are generated to detect structural changes, and critical value preservation rates are monitored to ensure regulatory compliance.

Validation rules include prohibited phrase detection, format-specific validation for different slot types (BOOLEAN, ENUM, LIMITED_TEXT, NUMERIC), and LLM artifact cleaning to remove generation markers that shouldn't appear in final documents.

**Claude Code Session Management (.claude/hooks/):**
The repository implements a sophisticated session management system through Claude Code hooks. The `shared_state.py` file (553 lines - another "god object") manages DAIC (Discussion/Implementation) mode switching, task state tracking, and persistent memory systems. The memory system stores entities, relations, and episodes with temporal decay for relevance scoring.

Session hooks include `session-start.py` which initializes context and loads relevant memory, `sessions-enforce.py` which enforces DAIC workflow and branch consistency, and `user-messages.py` which detects trigger phrases and provides context enrichment. All these hooks contain bare exception handlers (lines 22, 49 in session-start.py; line 53 in sessions-enforce.py; line 31 in user-messages.py) that catch all exceptions without specific handling.

**Memory and State Persistence:**
The persistent memory system in `.claude/state/memory/` stores knowledge across sessions using JSON-based storage. Memory configuration includes hardcoded limits: `max_entities: 5000`, `max_episodes: 1000`, `max_observations_per_entity: 100`, and `max_memory_size_mb: 10`. These values appear in `shared_state.py` lines 151-153 and throughout the memory management functions.

Privacy protection is implemented through forbidden pattern detection, automatically excluding credentials, API keys, and sensitive environment variables from memory storage. Temporal decay is applied using exponential functions to decrease relevance scores over time.

### For Technical Debt Refactoring: What Needs to Be Addressed

**CORS Security Issue (CRITICAL):**
The `allow_origins=["*"]` configuration in `app/main.py:28` creates a significant security vulnerability. This wildcard setting allows requests from any domain, potentially enabling cross-origin attacks. The current implementation bypasses the same-origin policy entirely, which is particularly dangerous for a document processing system that might handle sensitive regulatory information.

**Bare Exception Handlers (HIGH PRIORITY):**
Four bare `except:` statements throughout the hook files catch all exceptions without specific handling. In `session-start.py` at lines 22 and 49, exceptions during configuration loading and hook detection are silently ignored. In `sessions-enforce.py` at line 53, git operations failures are caught broadly. In `user-messages.py` at line 31, configuration loading errors are suppressed. These broad exception handlers mask important errors and make debugging difficult.

**Hardcoded Configuration Values (HIGH PRIORITY):**
Multiple hardcoded values are scattered throughout the codebase:
- Memory limits in `shared_state.py` (max_entities: 5000, max_episodes: 1000, max_observations_per_entity: 100)
- Token processing limits in `task-transcript-link.py` (MAX_TOKENS_PER_BATCH: 18000)
- Content truncation limits in test files and processing pipelines (200, 150, 8000, 4000 characters)
- Test data paths hardcoded to "test_data/HUM00173014.pdf" in multiple test files

These values should be externalized to configuration files to enable environment-specific tuning and easier maintenance.

**God Objects Requiring Refactoring:**
Several files exceed 400 lines and violate single responsibility principle:
- `document_framework.py` (656 lines) - combines orchestration, validation, metrics, and processing
- `clinical_protocol_plugin.py` (571 lines) - handles plugin logic, validation, template management, and agent coordination
- `shared_state.py` (553 lines) - manages DAIC mode, task state, memory operations, and configuration

**Long Functions (MEDIUM PRIORITY):**
Multiple functions exceed 50 lines and should be broken down:
- `sessions-enforce.py:find_git_repo()` (189 lines) - handles git repository detection with complex logic
- `test_consistency.py:run_consistency_test()` (264 lines) - manages test orchestration, metrics calculation, and file I/O
- `user-messages.py:get_context_length_from_transcript()` (195 lines) - parses transcript files, calculates token usage, and handles multiple data formats

**Deprecated API Endpoints (LOW PRIORITY):**
Lines 281-303 in `app/main.py` contain deprecated endpoints (`/document-types/` and `/document-types/{document_type}/`) that are maintained for backward compatibility but should be removed after migration to the new `/plugins/` endpoints is complete.

**Incomplete Implementation (MEDIUM PRIORITY):**
The multi-agent system in `app/core/multi_agent_system.py` contains placeholder implementations starting around line 128. Critical agent orchestration logic is missing, which impacts the system's ability to coordinate complex document generation workflows.

**Print Statement Proliferation (MEDIUM PRIORITY):**
The codebase contains 315+ print statements across 17 files, indicating a lack of proper logging infrastructure. These print statements make debugging difficult and provide no log level control or structured output formatting.

### Technical Reference Details

#### Critical Files and Line Numbers
- **CORS Configuration**: `app/main.py:28` - Replace wildcard with specific origins
- **Bare Exception Handlers**: 
  - `session-start.py:22, 49`
  - `sessions-enforce.py:53`
  - `user-messages.py:31`
- **Hardcoded Memory Limits**: `shared_state.py:151-153` - Extract to config file
- **Token Batch Limit**: `task-transcript-link.py:MAX_TOKENS_PER_BATCH` line 31
- **Incomplete Agent System**: `multi_agent_system.py:128+` - Complete placeholder methods

#### Configuration Requirements
Memory limits should be externalized to:
```json
{
  "memory": {
    "max_entities": 5000,
    "max_episodes": 1000, 
    "max_observations_per_entity": 100,
    "max_memory_size_mb": 10
  },
  "processing": {
    "max_tokens_per_batch": 18000,
    "content_truncation_limits": {
      "short_summary": 200,
      "medium_summary": 150,
      "long_content": 8000,
      "extended_content": 4000
    }
  },
  "test_data": {
    "default_pdf": "test_data/HUM00173014.pdf"
  }
}
```

#### Refactoring Approach
The god objects should be refactored using domain separation:
- Split `document_framework.py` into orchestrator, validator, and metrics classes
- Separate `clinical_protocol_plugin.py` into plugin, validator, and template manager classes
- Divide `shared_state.py` into DAIC manager, task manager, and memory manager modules

Long functions should be extracted using single responsibility principle, creating helper functions for distinct operations like git detection, file parsing, and metrics calculation.
