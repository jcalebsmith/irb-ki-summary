# Integration Test Suite

## Objective
Create comprehensive integration tests using real data and real API calls - absolutely no mocks allowed.

## Scope
- Create new test files for all modules
- Update existing tests to use real connections
- Remove all mock objects
- Test with actual PDFs and API calls

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Real OpenAI API calls
- [ ] Real PDF document processing
- [ ] Real database connections (if applicable)
- [ ] Real file system operations
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Test Categories to Create
- [ ] Document upload and processing
- [ ] LLM integration with real API
- [ ] Evidence extraction from real PDFs
- [ ] Template rendering with real data
- [ ] Plugin system with real plugins
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration
- [ ] API endpoint integration
- [ ] Error handling scenarios

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Remove all mock objects from tests
- [ ] Set up test data with real PDFs
- [ ] Configure test API credentials
- [ ] Create end-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Implement test data cleanup
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] Create continuous integration setup

## Real Data Requirements
- [ ] Sample IRB consent forms
- [ ] Clinical protocol documents
- [ ] Various PDF formats and sizes
- [ ] Edge case documents
- [ ] Malformed documents for error testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 100% real data and API usage
- [ ] No mock objects in codebase
- [ ] >80% code coverage
- [ ] All tests passing with real connections
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured
