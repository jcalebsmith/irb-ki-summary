# Multi-Agent System Simplification

## Objective
Streamline agent orchestration, remove unnecessary complexity, and ensure clear agent responsibilities.

## Scope
- app/core/multi_agent_system.py
- app/core/agent_interfaces.py
- Agent interaction patterns

## Current Complexity Issues
- [ ] Overly complex agent communication
- [ ] Unclear agent boundaries
- [ ] Redundant agent types
- [ ] Complex orchestration logic
- [ ] Missing agent error handling

## Simplification Strategy
- [ ] Define clear agent responsibilities
- [ ] Remove redundant agent types
- [ ] Simplify inter-agent communication
- [ ] Implement clear agent lifecycle
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Audit all agent types and their usage
- [ ] Consolidate similar agents
- [ ] Create simple agent base class
- [ ] Implement clear message passing
- [ ] Add agent timeout handling
- [ ] Create agent pool management

## Agent Types to Review
- [ ] ExtractionAgent
- [ ] GenerationAgent
- [ ] ValidationAgent
- [ ] IntentPreservationAgent
- [ ] SpecialistAgent
- [ ] OrchestrationAgent

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test agent communication with real data
- [ ] Validate agent error handling
- [ ] Test agent timeout scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple agents
- [ ] Integration tests with full workflow

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear, single-responsibility agents
- [ ] Simple agent communication protocol
- [ ] Robust error handling
- [ ] All tests with real data passing
- [ ] Reduced orchestration complexity
- [ ] Performance improvements documented
