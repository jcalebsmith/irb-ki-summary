Run 1: \"in small numbers of people\" + \"bone marrow aspirate\"\n2. Run 2: \"in people\" + \"bone marrow aspirate samples\"\n3. Run 3: \"in small numbers of people\" + \"bone marrow aspirate\"\n4.

Run 6: \"in people\" + \"bone marrow aspirate\"\n7. Run 7-10: \"in small numbers of people\" + mentions \"blood and bone marrow aspirate samples\"\n\n**Section 6 variations (Risks):**\n- Most: \"infusion-related reactions, severe infections, bone marrow biopsy discomfort\"\n- Some include \"and\" before the last item\n- Run 6: \"bone marrow biopsy pain\" instead of \"discomfort\", different order\n\n**Section 7 variations (Benefits):**\n- Most: \"may not offer any benefit to you now but may benefit others in the future\"\n- Some: \"by advancing knowledge of multiple myeloma treatment outcomes\"\n- Some: \"by advancing knowledge of multiple myeloma treatment strategies\"\n\n**Section 9 variations (Alternatives):**\n- Most: \"chemotherapy, biologic therapies, radiation, or stem cell transplantation\"\n\n\n- Some: \"chemotherapy, biologic therapies, or stem cell transplantation\" (radiation missing)\n\nI notice subtle linguistic variations across multiple runs. These nuanced differences appear in participant descriptions, biospecimen terminology, and treatment alternatives. The variations seem minor but demonstrate the model's ability to generate slightly different but contextually similar responses.\n\nThe key observations reveal a consistent core message with flexible language generation. Slight changes in phrasing, word choice, and list completeness suggest a dynamic but controlled output approach.\n\nThe low coefficient of variation indicates remarkable linguistic stability while maintaining semantic flexibility. Minor word adjustments occur without fundamentally altering the underlying informational content.",

Add stricter template constraints for these specific phrases\n2. Use temperature=0 in the LLM calls to reduce randomness\n3. Add post-processing to normalize these common variations\n\nHowever, the current 0.548% CV indicates the system is performing excellently for word count consistency, which is the primary metric for document length stability."
