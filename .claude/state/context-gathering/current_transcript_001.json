They lack:\n- Proper citations and references to sources\n- Deep analysis with evidence-based reasoning\n- Detailed justification for insights and conclusions\n- Rich contextual information and cross-referencing\n\nNeed to systematically review the entire codebase to understand how to significantly improve the depth of analysis and report writing quality.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Complete audit of current report generation pipeline and identify all quality bottlenecks\n- [ ] Document all intermediate data flows (insights, synthesis, semantic chunks) with quality assessment\n- [ ] Identify specific areas where depth is lost in the research process\n- [ ] Create detailed improvement recommendations with implementation approach\n- [ ] Implement logging system for intermediate outputs (insights, evidence, justifications) for quality review\n- [ ] Design enhanced report structure that includes citations, evidence chains, and confidence levels\n- [ ] Prototype improvements to demonstrate enhanced depth and quality\n\n## Context Files\n<!-- Added by context-gathering agent or manually -->\n- @src/mastra/tests/runResearchBaseline.ts\n- @src/mastra/networks/streamingResearchNetwork.ts\n- @src/mastra/agents/researchAgent.ts\n- @src/mastra/agents/synthesisAgent.ts\n- @src/mastra/agents/reportWriterAgent.ts\n- @src/mastra/storage/neo4jStorage.ts\n\n## User Notes\n- Reports currently lack references/citations\n- Intermediate insights should be logged for quality review\n- Need to track evidence and justification throughout the pipeline\n- Focus on improving analytical depth at each stage\n\n## Work Log\n<!-- Updated as work progresses -->\n- [2025-09-09] Task created for systematic review of report quality pipeline"
