KEY INFORMATION

Purpose of the Study:
This research study is testing a new experimental drug called XYZ-123 to see if it can reduce 
the frequency of migraine headaches in adults. The drug has shown promise in early laboratory 
studies but has not yet been approved by the FDA.

Study Duration:
Your participation in this study will last approximately 6 months, with monthly clinic visits
for the first 3 months, then follow-up visits at months 4 and 6.

Randomization:
If you agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive 
either XYZ-123 or a placebo (inactive substance). Neither you nor the study doctor will know 
which treatment you are receiving.

Key Risks:
The most common side effects observed in previous studies include mild nausea (30% of participants),
headache at injection site (25%), and temporary dizziness (15%). There is also a small risk of 
allergic reaction.

Benefits:
You may experience a reduction in migraine frequency and severity. However, there is no guarantee
that you will benefit from participation. The knowledge gained may help future patients with migraines.

Alternatives:
You do not have to participate in this study. Alternative treatments include standard migraine 
medications such as triptans, preventive medications, or lifestyle modifications.
